# Developer Education

## Motivation

I get asked a lot by junior developer friends and colleagues:

- how did you learn to write good tests?
- how do know how to structure the application?
- where did you learn to apply that pattern?
- how do you manage your time?
- which books on IT are worth reading?
- what skills are needed to become a true professional?
- etc.

I was teaching development to friends and colleagues for a while already, telling the same things over and over again and answering the same questions over and over for years. And every time I get to know new beginners or aspiring professionals in new teams the questions get raised again. The answers I give are battle proven and are rarely taught at schools, boot camps and universities. 

This repository is an attempt to collect my **opinionated** wisdom which I gained in about one and a half decades in the industry. It is a living document and I will present it in a structured way. I will provide a path to mastery in form of a study guide. You will have to walk the path yourself but you don't have to walk it alone. Support is always a call or message away. Also connect among each other.

1. SOLID Principles.

### Refactoring
- **Book:** Refactoring Second Edition, Martin Fowler, [O'Reilley link.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/refactoring-improving-the/9780134757681/)
- Read and practice the first chapter. Code the example yourself, [Tests and Kata Setup](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2024-refactoring-code-samples.html).
- Study the code smells and how to resolve them.
- Pick a class or module from your current project and apply what you learned in a feature branch. Create a PR and get it merged.
- Read at least till the Refactorings Catalog. Continue if you like and have time. Otherwise move on to second topic.

### Test Driven Development
- **Book 1:** Test Driven Development by Example, Kent Beck, [O'Reilley link.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development/0321146530/)
- Read it entirely, its short.
- Practice the example in the first chapter in your language. He uses Python.
- Understand the workflow: red, green, refactor.
- **Book 2:** Clean Craftsmanship by Robert Martin, [O'Reilley link.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-craftsmanship-disciplines/9780136915805/), [the videos on O'Reilley.](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/clean-craftsmanship-disciplines/9780137676385/)
- Watch the videos and read the chapters about TDD und practice all the examples in your language. He uses Java.
- Memorise the rules. Practice the small steps.
- Its hard, I know. Keep on practicing. The reward is big. It will change your code for ever.
